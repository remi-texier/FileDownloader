# File downloader

## Simple file downloader that I usually use for downloading batches of pdf

This will download all the files of a web page, I occasionally need it on online courses for example.

The script takes 3 arguments, respectively the URL, the file extension needed (limited to one per call for now) and the destination folder where the files will be stored. If the specified destination folder doesn't exit yet, it will be created.

## How to use

## Limitations
As of writing this I have only tested the script on Linux, I think it would work fine on MacOS, but I am not sure about windows.
